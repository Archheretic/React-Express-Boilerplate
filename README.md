## Installation

Clone the project then install by typing the following in a terminal inside
the projects root directory:
```sh
$ npm install
```

If you you dont have mysql or mariadb install, do the follow:

Install mariadb or mysql

Examples on how to install
```sh
$ pacman -S mariadb
```

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install mariadb
```

After mariadb is installed type:
```sh
$ mysql -u root -p
```

If you do not use user root with a blank password then you have to edit
the respective values in the database config files.
To change the database settings go to [config](config).
 - [config/default.json](config/default.json) is the production database.
 - [config/dev.json](config/dev) is the development database.
 - [config/test.json](config/test) is for the test database.

Your terminal should now look like this:
```sh
 MariaDB [(none)]>
```

Copypaste the data from the databaseDev script located at [scripts/databaseDev.sql](scripts/databaseDev.sql)
paste into the terminal and click enter.

## How to run

First:
```sh
$ npm run build
```

When that's complete run:
```sh
$ npm start
```

If you're not developing on the React front end, skip the following instructions.

Then open another terminal window and type:
```sh
$ npm run hotload
```

When given the below prompt click enter (default Y)

```sh
Would you like to run the app on another port instead? (Y/n)
```

A hot loadable React instance should now run on Port 3001.
